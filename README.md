# HTML2PDF

Javascript-based solution that gives the ability to convert a HTML document to PDF using any JS library or custom JS in a one-to-one manner. I need the PDF to look exactly like the HTML document

I must have all text kept editable (i.e. so it can be copied), and I must have images also rendered in the generated PDF.
